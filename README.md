# il cervellone

This project arises from the need to transform aesthetically and functionally problematic websites into pleasant and modern experiences. Often, there are websites with excellent content that are hindered by outdated design and poor usability. My goal was to rescue one of these sites from "ugliness" by improving its visual appearance and functionality.

I chose to redesign the website of **il cervellone** ([www.ilcervellone.it](http://www.ilcervellone.it/)), a site with enormous potential but in need of a design update.
